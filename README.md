# PBnB-feasibility determination
1. Level_set_function.py  is  the test function called sinusoidal function with one constraint f(x) <-2.3

2.YT_Qu_conservative.py  is the algorithm for PBnB, the version of the algorithm containt Dynamic Partition Scheme and Probability of elimination and the pruning and maintaining criteria is based on the quantile of the distance
